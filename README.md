# Apache Spark ML Programming Examples
This repository contains examples of real-time machine learning pipelines running on Apache Spark ML.

1. Fraud detection: An online fraud detection system that uses Spark ML to analyze transaction data in real-time and identify patterns indicative of fraud.

2. Recommender systems: A recommendation engine that uses Spark ML to analyze user behavior data in real-time and generate personalized product recommendations.

3. Anomaly detection: A system that uses Spark ML to analyze sensor data in real-time and identify patterns that deviate from the norm, indicating an anomaly.

4. Image recognition: An image recognition system that uses Spark ML to analyze video streams in real-time and identify objects or people in the frame.

5. Natural Language Processing: A NLP pipeline using Spark ML that can process a large amount of text data in real-time and extract insights.

6. Predictive cost analysis of Spark Applications: A system that uses Spark Listener data to analyzed cost impact of suboptimal code.

7. Traffic forecasting: A system that uses real-time traffic data to predict traffic congestion and adjust traffic signals accordingly.
