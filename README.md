# Apache Spark ML Programming Examples
Examples of Machine Learning pipelines development with Scala and Spark

1. Collaborative Filtering for Recommender Systems: Spark's MLlib library includes a collaborative filtering algorithm that can be used to build personalized recommendation systems.

2. Distributed Linear Regression: Spark's MLlib also includes a linear regression algorithm that can be used to train models on large datasets distributed across a cluster.

3. Distributed Decision Trees and Random Forests: Spark's MLlib includes both decision tree and random forest algorithms for classification and regression tasks. These algorithms can be run on large datasets distributed across a cluster.

4. Clustering: Spark's MLlib includes the K-means algorithm for clustering large datasets.

5. Natural Language Processing: Spark's MLlib includes various NLP tools such as tokenization, stemming, and stop-word removal that can be used to preprocess text data.

6. Image Processing: Spark can be used to process large image datasets using the OpenCV library.

7. Time Series Forecasting: Spark's MLlib includes a time series forecasting algorithm that can be used to predict future values of a time series based on historical data.
