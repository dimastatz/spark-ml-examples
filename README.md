# Apache Spark ML Programming Examples
Examples of Machine Learning pipelines development with Scala and Apache Spark ML

1. Fraud Detection: Spark is used to process large datasets of financial transactions to detect fraudulent activity. Machine learning algorithms can be trained on historical data to identify patterns associated with fraud and then applied to new data to detect potential fraud.

2. Predictive Maintenance: Spark is used to process large datasets of sensor data from industrial equipment to predict when maintenance is needed. Machine learning algorithms can be trained on historical data to identify patterns associated with equipment failure and then applied to new data to predict when maintenance is needed.

3. Network Intrusion Detection: Spark is used to process large datasets of network traffic to detect intrusions. Machine learning algorithms can be trained on historical data to identify patterns associated with network intrusions and then applied to new data to detect potential intrusions.

4. Healthcare: Spark is used to process large datasets of medical records to identify patterns and predict outcomes. Machine learning algorithms can be trained on historical data to identify patterns associated with disease progression and then applied to new data to predict patient outcomes.

5. Quality Control: Spark is used to process large datasets of production data to detect defects. Machine learning algorithms can be trained on historical data to identify patterns associated with defects and then applied to new data to detect potential defects.

6. Image Processing: Spark is used to process large image datasets using the OpenCV library.

7. Predictive Modeling: Spark is used to process large datasets of data to predict future outcomes. Machine learning algorithms can be trained on historical data to identify patterns and predict outcomes using various techniques such as supervised, unsupervised, and deep learning.
