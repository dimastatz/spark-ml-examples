# Apache Spark ML Programming Examples
This repository contains examples of real-time machine learning pipelines running on Apache Spark ML.

1. Predictive cost analysis of Cloud Applications: analyzing logs and profilind data to measure the cost impact of suboptimal code and recommends optimizations steps.

2. Drowning detection systems: analyze video streaming data from swimming pools cameras to detect incidents and notifications to safety personnel in the real time.

3. Lead Scoring for Sales: ranking the sales readiness of a lead to reduce end-to-end life cycle of selling to and servicing customers. 

4. Anomaly detection: A system that uses Spark ML to analyze sensor data in real-time and identify patterns that deviate from the norm, indicating an anomaly.

4. Image recognition: An image recognition system that uses Spark ML to analyze video streams in real-time and identify objects or people in the frame.

5. Natural Language Processing: A NLP pipeline using Spark ML that can process a large amount of text data in real-time and extract insights.

6. 

7. Traffic forecasting: A system that uses real-time traffic data to predict traffic congestion and adjust traffic signals accordingly.
